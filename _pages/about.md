Welcome!
======

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and research assistant in FullStack Security Lab(FSSL)(https://tristartom.github.io/members.html) at Syracuse University since Fall 2022. I am honored to be advised by Dr. Yuzhe (Richard) Tang(@https://tristartom.github.io/). My research interests lie in Blockchain Security.

I received an M.S. in Computer Science from Syracuse University in 2022, B.S. in Computer Science from East China Normal University(https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) in 2019.
